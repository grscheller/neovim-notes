# My Neovim Notes

These notes have evolved over many years. They originally started out as
a single text file vi cheatsheet. I am trying to capture the base editor
behavior for basic text editing.

* [Absolute Minimum You Need to Know](notes/01-AbsoluteMinimalTextEditing.md)
* [Basic Text Editing](notes/02-BasicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](notes/03-VimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](notes/04-AdvTradViCommands.md)
* [Ex Mode and Scripting Neovim](notes/05-ExMode.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](notes/06-VimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Advanced Text Editing](notes/07-AdvTextEditing.md)
* [Multiple Neovim Windows](notes/08-MultipleWindows.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](notes/09-EncodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](notes/10-RegularExpressions.md)
* [Configuration](notes/11-Configuration.md)

I test this information against nvim, and sometimes with the vi which
comes with Arch Linux (Joy, Horton, Ritter).
