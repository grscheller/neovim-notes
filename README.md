# My Neovim Notes

These notes have evolved over many years.  They originally
started out as a single text file vi cheatsheet.

* [Absolute Minimum You Need to Know](notes/01-AbsoluteMinimalTextEditing.md)
* [Basic Text Editing](notes/02-BasicTextEditing.md)
* [Vim Factoids](notes/03-VimFactoids.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](notes/04-AdvTradViCommands.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](notes/05-VimSpecificFeatures.md)
* [Multiple Neovim Windows](notes/06-MultipleWindows.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](notes/07-EncodingsUnicode.md)
* [Regular Expressions](notes/08-RegularExpressions.md)
* [Plugins](notes/09-Plugins.md)
* [Vimscript](notes/10-Vimscript.md)
* [Lua](notes/11-Lua.md)
* [Neovim Configuration & Maintenance](notes/12-Configuration.md)

Since Neovim has become my daily programming driver,
I test this information against only nvim, and sometimes
with the vi which comes with Arch Linux (Joy, Horton, Ritter),
not vim in vi mode.
