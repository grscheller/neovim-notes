# My Neovim Notes

These notes have evolved over many years.  They originally
started out as a single text file vi cheatsheet.

* [Absolute Minimum You Need to Know](AbsoluteMinimalTextEditing01.md)
* [Basic Text Editing](BasicTextEditing02.md)
* [Vim Factoids](VimFactoids03.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](AdvTradViCommands04.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](VimSpecificFeatures05.md)
* [Multiple Neovim Windows](MultipleWindows06.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](EncodingsUnicode07.md)
* [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions08.md)
* [Vimscript](Vimscript09.md)
* [Lua](Lua10.md)
* [Configuring Neovim](Configuration11.md)

Unfortunately, Vim and Neovim are beginning to diverge.

Since Neovim has become my daily programming driver,
I test this information against only nvim, and sometimes
with the vi which comes with Arch Linux (Joy, Horton, Ritter),
not vim in vi mode.
