# My Neovim Notes

These notes have evolved over many years.  They originally
started out as a text file vi cheatsheet.

* [Absolute Minimum You Need to Know](AbsoluteMinimalTextEditing01.md)
* [Basic Text Editing](BasicTextEditing02.md)
* [Vim Factoids](VimFactoids03.md)
* [Advanced Traditional Vi Commands](AdvTradViCommands04.md)
* [Vim Specific Features](VimSpecificFeatures05.md)
* [Multiple Neovim Windows](MultipleWindows06.md)
* [Encodings and Unicode](EncodingsUnicode07.md)
* [Regular Expressions](RegularExpressions08.md)
* [Configuring Neovim](Configurations09.md)

Neovim has become my daily programming driver.  As such,
I am only testing this information against nvim and
sometimes pre-vim vi.  Unfornunately, vim and nvim are
beginning to diverge.
